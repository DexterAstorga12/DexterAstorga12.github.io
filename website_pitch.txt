THE OECES WEBSITE PROJECT:

the thing is: 
	madali maglagay ng website sa internet
	    ang mahirap ay magdesign ng website
	this project is demanding
	this is a bigger project than the others since name ng org
		ang nakataya, kapag kase naglaunch tayo ng website e 
		open for criticism yan kasi ibuview rin yan ng ibang courses 
		or even other professors so we cant push binasta nang website
 	this project needs a lot of time and as many work force as 
		it can possibly get kase pare parehas lang tayung konti lang	
		experience sa pagdedesign ng website
	if ever tapos na natin yung website:
		we can retain the oeces.github.io website name or we can go the 
		more professional route and change our website name for something
		like oeces.com or oeces.org pero gagastos tayo. kung didistribute
		naman yung payment sa oeces members, we can get 1 year of owning
		that professional website name
		note:
 			check first kung atin ba talaga yung oeces na naman kasi
				baka malaw suit tayo kung may ibang nagpatrademark sa 	
				name na oeces.
	it is important to note na mahirap talagang gumawa ng maganda at functional
		website, there is a reason why experienced web designers cost you 
		12K-15K pesos for 1 pager websites kasi this is a lot of work talaga
		
 
plan a:
 get a template online
	pros:	
		easier to the developers since the 
		  structure of the website is already defined
		relatively lesser time
	cons:
		the website structure: what we see is what we got
		  (especially di naman kami masyadong experienced sa 
		  front end web designing kasi yung iba may konti lang exp
		  tas ako naman e backend web development yung ginagawa ko sa ojt.
		mahirap sundan ang css stylesheet

plan b: 
 create the website from the ground up
	pros:
		we can get the desired structure of website pati lahat ng gusto
			nating mailagay (provided na naaral nang ayos kung pano gawin)
		more control on the website

	cons:
		maraming aaralin
		mahabang time ang kailangan
